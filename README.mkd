SpaceApi
========

Canonical repository for the SpaceState API.

Branches
--------

There are two primary branches: master and devel

```master``` is the "gold standard current API", the current stable API which spaces
should implement.

```devel``` is the experimental branch where features and fixes are accrued
between releases.

Extending the API
-----------------

API extensions are welcome and encouraged! If you would like to propose an API
extension, please contact our [mailing list on the hackerspaces.org
mailman](http://lists.hackerspaces.org/mailman/listinfo/spaceapi-devel) so
that we can discuss your changes. When you are ready to integrate them, please
open a pull request pointed towards the devel branch.

Please do not adjust the changelog or API version tag; we will change this
when we tag put out a new release.

Adding your space to the directory
----------------------------------

Edit ``spacestatusdirectory.php'' and add your space to the large list of spaces:

```php
  'TechInc' => 'https://techinc.nl/space/spacestate.json',
```

Commit this with a message along the lines of "Add FOOLABS to Space Directory"
and pull request against the master branch.
